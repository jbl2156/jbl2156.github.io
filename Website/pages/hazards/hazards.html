            <div class="a">Should Autonomous Vehicles be allowed onto the open roads? The answer will be yes in the coming years, the roads are just a cesspool of accidents waiting to happen. With 5,419,000 automobile accidents and almost 30,000 fatalities just in the last year alone people are looking for answers, and we think that self-driving cars are the answer. With proper calibration and testing, when safety can be guaranteed people will be taking full advantage of autonomous vehicles.</div>
            
            <div class="a">There are some situations that get brought up to question that validity of these machines on the road, the most popular being the train scenario. If there was a child standing on train tracks and an elderly lady standing on a different set of rails, there is a switch to change the tracks so that one of them can survive, now pick which person to save. This scenario has no right or wrong answers, it’s all about reasoning, now let’s paint a picture that incorporates driverless vehicles. If a scenario arises that has 3 choices, a self-driving car with passengers is driving down the road and a ball comes rolling out followed by a small child. The car detects the child but does not have enough time to come to a safe stop without hitting the kid. The computer can decide to swerve right into a concrete barrier to avoid the child, swerve left into oncoming traffic or try and stop but risks hitting the child. What is the best solution, endanger the passengers inside the car? Or possibly endanger the passengers other cars on the road by swerving left? There isn’t a correct answer but technology is showing promise that the computer will be able to calculate the probability of survival and decide based on hard numbers.</div>
            
            <div class="a">People are scared to have their lives in the “hands” of a robot. But today there are many things that robots do to help humans and no one has any complaints about them, robots performing surgery and keeping humans alive in hospitals.</div>
            
            <div class="a">It is important to form your own opinion about the coming future and the technology associated with it. But there is no way to tell how it will pan out until the day comes when we have autonomous vehicles flooding the streets and hopefully there is a positive effect on the world.</div>
