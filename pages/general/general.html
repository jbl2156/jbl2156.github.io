                The world we live in is full of inefficiencies, we all might not notice or acknowledge them but there is always something different that can be done to complete the task faster, with less waste or just in a smarter way, and driving cars on roads is no exception. Automobiles are the dominant mode of travel with luxury and utility vehicles available, the individual person benefits greatly, but the consequences of this are a great cost to society. Single occupancy vehicles (SOV) contributes to traffic congestion, delays and vehicle pollution. Congestion costs the U.S. economy more than $120 billion dollars, over 56 billion pounds of CO2 from SOV emissions, and an estimated 30,000 vehicle fatalities. Attempts have been made to find solutions to these problems, but most fall short when they try to tackle multiple problems at once. For example, the change from gasoline-powered vehicles to electric-powered ones reduces transportation-related carbon emissions but does little to reduce congestion or motor vehicle fatalities. Self-driving cars could be the answer to our problems, with ever advancing technology autonomous vehicles become even safer and smarter each day that passes.

                What exactly is a driverless car and how does it work? Self-driving cars are defined as motor vehicles capable of automated driving and navigation entirely without direct human input. As for how they work, the cars sense their surroundings with techniques such as radar, GPS, and computer vision and advanced control systems interpret the sensor information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage. This may come off as technical jargon but it is quite easy to understand, the sensors that are on the outside of the car record information and that information is then used by the car to move, brake or accelerate based on the situation that it is in. Self-driving cars can see, detect and react to almost any circumstances, whether it be a pedestrian walking into the road or a falling rock on the highway, the robotic car will make the correct decision.

                It is important to acknowledge where humans fall short in regards to transportation as well as comprehending how autonomous vehicles fundamentally work, once a basic understanding is established individuals can form their own opinions on the subject of driverless cars.
